# Job Tracker

## Overview

**Job Tracker** is a simple web application designed to help job seekers keep track of the number of jobs they apply for each day. This is the initial version of the project, built entirely using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of the application is to streamline the job application process by providing a centralized platform to monitor job submissions.

As I am actively searching for a job, this project reflects my personal need for tracking job applications. The current version focuses on counting daily applications, with plans to expand its functionality in future iterations.

## Features

- **Track daily job applications**: Record the number of jobs applied for each day.
- **Simple and intuitive design**: Clean user interface built with HTML and CSS.
- **Interactive frontend**: Dynamically update the daily job count with JavaScript.
- **Future plans**:
  - Store detailed information about the companies applied to.
  - Add a feature to track the status of applications (e.g., pending, interview, rejected, offer).
  - Implement backend features using **Node.js** to store job application data persistently.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend (Planned)**: Node.js (future implementation)
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Since this is a frontend-focused project, all you need is a web browser to run the current version of the app.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shereen-esther/job-tracker.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd job-tracker
   ```
3. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to use the application:
   ```bash
   open index.html
   ```

## Future Improvements

In upcoming versions, I plan to:

- **Backend Integration**: Introduce a backend system using **Node.js** to persist data such as company details, job status, and more.
- **Database**: Store application data using a database (e.g., MongoDB or Firebase).
- **Additional Features**: Implement filtering and sorting options for job applications and display statistics on job search progress.

## Contribution

This is a personal project to improve my backend development skills. However, if you'd like to contribute or suggest improvements, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
